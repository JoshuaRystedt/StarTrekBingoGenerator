# Star Trek Bingo Generator
*Very* simple Python script to randomly generate bingo cards to play while watching Star Trek the Original Series.

Bingo cards usually have 25 spaces with the center space a "free" space.  

This script randomly selects 24 common occurrences from TOS and arranges them in a standard Bingo card format. It will then print a key to all items on your new Bingo card.
